# Health Predictions Web Application

# Introduction
The Health Predictions Web Application is a tool that utilizes a trained neural network to predict potential health issues based on user inputs. Currently, the system can predict the likelihood of heart disease, skin cancer, and other diseases. The underlying neural network has been trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

# Features
•	Predicts the likelihood of heart disease, skin cancer, and other diseases.
•	User-friendly web interface.
•	Trained neural network for accurate predictions.
•	Dataset used:
